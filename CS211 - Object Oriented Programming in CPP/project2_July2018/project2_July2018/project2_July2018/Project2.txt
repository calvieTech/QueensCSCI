Calvin ThangCS211 – Project 27/27/2018* For Q1.3, the print() method is allowed to call the date() method because not only is the date method in the same class and public but the date method returns a string.* For Q2.2, there are no changes required in the function body of release() because we are simply deallocating the memory for _vec and setting its memory address to NULL.  We don’t have to change data type like we did in void allocate().* For Q2.3, no changes are required in the function bodies for any of the constructors, copy, assignment operator and destructor because we are copying the same functionality from vec_int.  The pointer object vec is still going to be a dynamically allocated array just like vec_int.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to do any changes.* For Q2.4, there are no changes for clear() and pop_back() because in those void methods, we are dealing wit the same data type, int.* For Q2.10, the input to print is const because we don’t want to change anything from the input argument.  If Print() itself is a const member function, then it would have to not change any data members.
